## Level 6
The level 6 solutions have been implemented in Kotlin with the exception of problem number 4 (the one with the JavaFX create an instance problem). This was mainly because I am using the JDK11 and that doesn't include JavaFX out of the box. Therefore, I will have to include this and I will work on it soon.
